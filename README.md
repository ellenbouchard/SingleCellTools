# SingleCellTools
Ellen Bouchard's Personal Repository for single-cell analysis tools. 

This repository contains tools developed and used by me to aid in processing and analyzing single-cell sequencing data in R.
These tools primarily consist of wrapper functions for Seurat functions in R.
I made this repository to organize and share the code that I developed to streamline my analyses. 

Contents:
1. QC_functions.R : Functions used to run a quality-control pipeline on a collection of Seurat objects.
2. integration_functions.R : Functions used to run a merging and integration pipeline on a collection of Seurat objects.
3. graph_functions.R : Functions used to graph the results of single-cell analyses, including volcano plots, heatmaps, and GO term plots.
